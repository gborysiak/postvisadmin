INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------

*Note: INSTALL document does not cover installing postfix and amavis-new for your particular distro or from source.  This will cover how to alter an exsisting installation

MySQL Setup:

1) Create a database for your mail server.  Use an easy to recognize name such as postfix

2) Create an user that has read write access to the postfix database. Write these down, will be needed later.

3) Import the mysql.sql file into your database.  This will create the required tables for the mail server, amavis-new, and the web interface. 

****Currently PostVis Admin is written with MYSQLI_NUM for quicker MySQL queries, this requires that the tables match what is in the SQL file.  If extra fields are needed for other administration tools, you will want to add them at the end of the table. ****

MySQL setup is now complete.


PostFix Setup

Follow the postfix setup at the following url:

http://postfix.wiki.xs4all.nl/index.php?title=Virtual_Users_and_Domains_with_Courier-IMAP_and_MySQL

You can skip the inital setup of mysql tables, this has been done in the mysql setup.


Amavis-New Setup
----------------------------------------------------------
#NOTE: If you have a working Postfix/Amavis-New setup working, skip to step #3

1)Edit your postfix main.cf (usually located /etc/postfix) Add the following line:

content_filter = amavis:[127.0.0.1]:10024

2) Edit your master.cf (usually located /etc/postfix) Add the following:

amavis  unix    -       -       -       -       2       smtp
        -o smtp_data_done_timeout=1200
        -o smtp_send_xforward_command=yes
        -o disable_dns_lookups=yes
        -o max_use=20

127.0.0.1:10025 inet n - - - - smtpd
        -o content_filter=
        -o local_recipient_maps=
        -o relay_recipient_maps=
        -o smtpd_restriction_classes=
        -o smtpd_client_restrictions=
        -o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
        -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=
        -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
        -o strict_rfc821_envelopes=yes
        -o mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8
        -o smtpd_error_sleep_time=0
        -o smtpd_soft_error_limit=1001
        -o smtpd_hard_error_limit=1001

pre-cleanup unix n - - - 0 cleanup
        -o virtual_alias_maps=
        -o canonical_maps=
        -o sender_canonical_maps=
        -o recipient_canonical_maps=
        -o masquerade_domains=


2) edit the services on their approprate lines:

smtp    inet    n       -       -       -       -       smtpd
        -o cleanup_service_name=pre-cleanup

cleanup   unix  n       -       -       -       0       cleanup
        -o mime_header_checks=
        -o nested_header_checks=
        -o body_checks=
        -o header_checks=


3) Edit your amavis.conf (Debian users should add the following to the /etc/amavis/conf.d/50-user file)

@lookup_sql_dsn = ( ['DBI:mysql:database=<DATABASE>;host=<HOST>', '<USERNAME>', '<PASSWORD>'] );
@storage_sql_dsn = @lookup_sql_dsn;
$banned_files_quarantine_method = 'sql:';
$spam_quarantine_method         = 'sql:';

3a) Make sure to edit the first line and change the <> tags to your information


4) restart amavis and postfix and verify that they are still working by

5) Optional: Set your default values for Amavis in your amavis.conf file(50-user for Debian).  If Amavis-new can not find valid rules for a domain in SQL, it will use the default values found in the conf file.
